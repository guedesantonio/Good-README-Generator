  ## Description
  When creating an open source project on GitHub, it is important to have a professional README with information about the app. A command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of a project README to get started quickly. This will allow a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README. This command line application dynamically generates a professional README.md from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

  ## Installation
  npm install

  ## Usage
   First the user needs to run the app in your system's command line by typing node index.js and it will then ask the user a series of questions to create an already formatted README.md file for your project using your inputs as the user. It will include a main title, with all the sub-headings for 'Description', a clickable 'Table of contents', 'Installation', 'Usage', 'License', 'Contributing', 'Tests' and 'Questions' sections. It will also shows a badge with a link to the type of license the user chose for the project at the top of the README.md file as a badge. Please watch a walkthrough video of how to use this app here.
